              JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
              compiled programming language with first-class functions.While it
              is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
              non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
              CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
              dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
              declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0–9).
            </p>
            <p>
              Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z"
              (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü
              in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can
              also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
              identifiers.

            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>
              With the keyword var. For example,
              <code> var x = 100;</code>
              This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
              variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              By simply assigning it a value. For example,
              <code>x = 100;</code>
              This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
              JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the keyword let. For example,
              <code>let y = 13.</code>
              This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
              See Variable scope below.
            </p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <div class="break-line">

          <article>
            <p>
              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called
              a global variable, because it is available to any other code in
              the current document. When you declare a variable within a
              function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
              only within that function.
            </p>

            <p>
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
              scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
              function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
              example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is
              the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not
              the block, which in this case is an if statement.
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced
              in ECMAScript 2015.
              <code
                >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y
                is not</code
              >
            </p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <div class="break-line">

            <h1>Global Variable</h1>
          </header>
          <article>
            <p>
              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In
              web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access
              global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
              window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
              window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
              phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
              variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>

            <h1>Constant</h1>
          </header>
          <article>
            <p>
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
              and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
              <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
              re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized
              to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
              is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
              <code>
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; //
                THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }
              </code>
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
              statement is executed without problems.
              <code
                >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";</code
              >

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                  <li>
                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                    NULL, or any other variant.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.

              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
              is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if
              the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
              See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and
              false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
              otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2
              can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have
              multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
              <code
                >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                statement_2;} else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                statement_last; }
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
              condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
              multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... })
              . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
              especially when nesting if statements:
              <code
                >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
              when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following
              code:
              <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
              common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
              assignment. For example:
              <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            </p>

            <p>
              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
              function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                curly brackets, { }.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example, the following code defines a simple function named
              square:

              <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              The function square takes one argument, called number. The
              function consists of one statement that says to return the
              argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
              The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
              <code>return number * number;</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
              value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
              changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
              globally or in the calling function.
